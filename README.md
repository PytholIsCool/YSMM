# Yandere Simulator Mod Manager

Although there's already a few existing platforms that could easily be adapted to be used as mod managers for Yandere Sim (for example, Nexus which actually does have some character mods for the game), nobody really uses them so I figured I'd fill in that role for the time being.
Additionally, most of those services put download speeds being paywalls which I frankly am not okay with. Now, people can have a mod manager that's only limited by their own internet connection!

## Features

This software offers:
- A base repo to download secure mods
- The ability to add more repos so you have more places to get your mods from
- A mods tab where you can select mods and then download them

> If you deselect a previously downloaded mod and then press the download button again, it'll uninstall the mod for you!

- Custom themes to personalize your manager
- No paywall for fast downloads; Everything is limited by your own internet!
